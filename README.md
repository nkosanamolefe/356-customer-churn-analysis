  Churn is a term used to describe the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company. Understanding churn is crucial because it directly impacts a company's growth and profitability.

Here's why it's important:
- Losing customers is expensive: It costs more to acquire new customers than to retain existing ones. 
- Churn impacts revenue: Losing customers means losing revenue, which can negatively impact a company's bottom line.
- Churn reveals problems: High churn rates can indicate issues with products, services, pricing, or customer service, all of which need to be addressed.

By understanding churn, companies can take steps to reduce it and improve customer loyalty, ultimately leading to greater success
