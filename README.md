  Churn is a term used to describe the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company. Understanding churn is crucial because it directly impacts a company's growth and profitability.

Here's why it's important:
- Losing customers is expensive: It costs more to acquire new customers than to retain existing ones. 
- Churn impacts revenue: Losing customers means losing revenue, which can negatively impact a company's bottom line.
- Churn reveals problems: High churn rates can indicate issues with products, services, pricing, or customer service, all of which need to be addressed.
