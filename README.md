  Churn is a term used to describe the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company. Understanding churn is crucial because it directly impacts a company's growth and profitability.

- Losing customers is expensive: It costs more to acquire new customers than to retain existing ones. 
- Churn impacts revenue: Losing customers means losing revenue, which can negatively impact a company's bottom line.
- Churn reveals problems: High churn rates can indicate issues with products, services, pricing, or customer service, all of which need to be addressed.

# Executive Summary
365, has demonstrated strong performance in customer retention while facing some challenges in refund management. The company generated net revenue of $666,720 between December 2021 and October 2022, representing a modest growth of 0.93% compared to the previous period.
A significant achievement has been the reduction in customer churn rates from 9% to 4% between December 2021 and October 2022, substantially outperforming industry benchmarks of 5-20%. This improvement indicates strong product-market fit and effective retention strategies. However, the company maintains a 10% refund rate, while aligned with industry standards, presents an opportunity for optimization.

Marketing campaigns have proven particularly effective for annual subscriptions, with new customer acquisition reaching peaks during promotional periods, notably exceeding 1,049 new subscribers during the Black Friday promotion. The monthly subscription model shows strong retention, with approximately 70% of customers maintaining recurring subscriptions.

Geographically, the United States leads in lifetime revenue generation at $640,102, benefiting from high disposable income and advanced technological adoption. Nigeria has emerged as a promising market in Africa, generating $37,441 in revenue.

To maintain this positive trajectory, 365 should focus on reducing refund rates through improved product quality and customer expectation management, while continuing successful retention strategies. The company should also consider targeted expansion in high-performing markets through localized content and strategic partnerships, particularly in Spanish-speaking regions where language barriers create competitive advantages.

These findings suggest that while 365 has established a strong foundation in customer retention and market presence, strategic investments in product quality, market expansion, and customer experience will be crucial for sustained growth and profitability.
